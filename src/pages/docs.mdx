  How to integrate my JIRA account with NVADR for issue tracking?
</h2>

- Integrating JIRA will make the task of tracking the issues and their progress easy.
- Go to settings ⟶ Integrations ⟶ issue tracking/ticketing.
- Provide your JIRA URL, Email, API Token and JIRA project key.
  - You use the JIRA URL to access your JIRA projects & tickets.
    If you are using JIRA cloud, it will look like this [https://your-company-name.atlassian.net].
  - JIRA Email will be the email-ID you use to access the JIRA software and with which you will generate the API token.
  - Here is a link on how to create your JIRA API Token -

  - The Project key is a unique identifier of your project where you will track all the issues.
